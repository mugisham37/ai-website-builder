# Email Integration Setup Guide

## Overview

This guide will help you set up the email functionality for your onboarding modal using Resend, a production-ready email service with a generous free tier.

## What's Been Implemented

### 1. Email API Route (`src/app/api/send-onboarding-email/route.ts`)

- Handles POST requests with form data
- Validates required fields
- Sends beautifully formatted HTML and text emails
- Includes error handling and logging
- Uses Resend for reliable email delivery

### 2. Updated OnboardingModal (`src/components/OnboardingModal.tsx`)

- Integrates with the email API
- Shows proper loading states
- Handles success and error scenarios
- Maintains user experience during email sending

### 3. Email Template Features

- Professional HTML design with responsive layout
- Includes all form data in organized sections
- Priority badges for urgent projects
- Quick action buttons (reply, call)
- Fallback text version for email clients

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Get Resend API Key

1. Go to [https://resend.com](https://resend.com)
2. Sign up for a free account (100 emails/day free tier)
3. Navigate to API Keys section
4. Create a new API key
5. Copy the API key (starts with `re_`)

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

1. Open `.env.local` file in your project root
2. Replace `your_resend_api_key_here` with your actual Resend API key:
   ```
   RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_actual_api_key_here
   ```

### Step 3: Domain Setup (Optional but Recommended)

For production use, you should verify your domain:

1. In Resend dashboard, go to Domains
2. Add your domain (e.g., `yourdomain.com`)
3. Add the required DNS records
4. Update the `from` field in the API route:
   ```typescript
   from: "Onboarding System <onboarding@yourdomain.com>";
   ```

If you don't have a domain, you can use Resend's default domain for testing:

```typescript
from: "Onboarding System <onboarding@resend.dev>";
```

### Step 4: Test the Integration

1. Start your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Open the onboarding modal
3. Fill out the form completely
4. Submit and watch for the loading animation
5. Check your email (mugisham505@gmail.com) for the formatted message

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Failed to send email" error**

   - Check your Resend API key is correct
   - Ensure `.env.local` file is in project root
   - Restart your development server after adding env vars

2. **Email not received**

   - Check spam/junk folder
   - Verify the recipient email (mugisham505@gmail.com)
   - Check Resend dashboard for delivery logs

3. **Domain verification issues**
   - DNS changes can take up to 48 hours
   - Use Resend's default domain for testing
   - Check DNS records are correctly added

### Development vs Production

**Development:**

- Use Resend's default domain
- Test with your own email first
- Monitor console logs for errors

**Production:**

- Set up custom domain
- Use environment variables for API keys
- Monitor Resend dashboard for delivery stats
- Consider adding email templates for different scenarios

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit API keys** - Always use environment variables
2. **Validate input data** - The API route includes validation
3. **Rate limiting** - Consider adding rate limiting for production
4. **Error handling** - Graceful error messages for users

## Scaling Considerations

### Free Tier Limits (Resend)

- 100 emails per day
- 3,000 emails per month
- Perfect for small to medium projects

### Paid Plans

- Start at $20/month for 50,000 emails

## Next Steps

1. **Customize email template** - Match your brand colors and style
2. **Add auto-responder** - Send confirmation email to the client
3. **Integrate with CRM** - Connect to your project management system
4. **Add analytics** - Track email open rates and responses
5. **A/B test templates** - Optimize for better response rates

## Support

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Review the Resend dashboard for delivery logs
3. Test with a simple email first
